what is the difference between Having and Where?
1. 
Having:  used only with ==> Group by and aggregate functions
Where :  used with any clasuse 
2. 
Having ==> working on summary rows 
where  ==> working on individal rows 


what is normalization?
it is the process of reorganizing the data in a way that prevents the data redundancy and dependency.
and decomposing the larger tables into small managable tables.


what is the difference between schema and database?
schema   : is a logical subset of the database representing a set of database objects that are related to each other
database : is the entire data that is represented by the database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc..
Ex: 
CompanyDB (Database)
   ├── HR_Schema (Schema)
   │     ├── employees (Table)
   │     ├── salaries (Table)
   │     └── departments (Table)
   ├── Sales_Schema (Schema)
   │     ├── customers (Table)
   │     ├── orders (Table)
   │     └── invoices (Table)

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language) : Insert, Delete, Update 
3. DQL (Data Query Language)        : Select 
4. TCL (Transaction Conrol Language): Commit, Rollback, Save Point 
5. DCL (Data Conrol Language)       : Grant, Revoke 


how to check if a value of an attribute is null?
by using 'is null' operator because we can not use  [ = null ] ==> becuase '=' operator is applied only on numbers or texts 

------ Logical operators --------
and  ==> select * from employees where fname = "ahmad" and salary=1500;
or   ==> select * from employees where fname = "ahmad" or salary=1500;
not  ==> select * from employees where not fname = "ahmad";

------ Between  &  Not Between operators --------
select * from employees where salary between 15000 and 25000;
select * from employees where salary not between 15000 and 25000;

------ IN  &  Not IN operators --------
select * form employees where salary in(10000,20000,30000); // get the salary that matches any of those 
select * form employees where salary not in(10000,20000,30000);

what are the data Definition Language (DDL) commands?
1. create 
2. alter
3. drop 
4. Rename 
5. Truncate

--- create ---
used to create a database object in the database.  ==> create table table_name;
--- alter ---
used to modify the sturucture of the database object
    & add column
    & drop column 
    & modify column  
--- drop --
used to destry a database object ==> drop table table_name;
--- rename ---
used to rename a database object ==> rename table table_name1 to table_name2;
--- Truncate --- 
used to permanently delete the data inside a database object. ==> Truncate table table_name;


What is the difference between Truncate and Delete?
Truncate table table_name; // deletes all the data inside this table permanently (No RollBack)
delete from table_name;    // deletes all the data inside this table temporarily (Can be RolledBack)

what is the difference between stored procedures and built-in functions?
- stored procedures  : a group of sequenced statements may return a value or not and can control the transaction (start, commit, rollback) and is called user [ 'Call' or 'Exec' keywords]
- built-in function : a ready-made function that is must return a value and can not control the transaction and is called using its name.

--------- Functions  ----------
what are the functions types in SQL?
1. String Functions : works on string data types 
2. Numberic Functions : works on numbers data types 
3. Date Functions :  works on Date data types rows
4. Aggregate Functions : works on all data types and results in summarized result sets  

A. ------- String Functions ----
1. upper("string")
2. lower("string")
3. length("string")
4. trim("  string  ")  // remove the spaces from the start and end of the string  
5. instr("string","char") // returns the position of a char inside a string 
6. substr("string",start_index,number_of_chars) // the string is 1-based indexing
7. Concat("str1","str2") // returns "str1" + "str2" 

B. ------- Numbers Functions ----
1. abs(-number)
2. mod(number1,number2)
3. sqrt(number)
4. power(number,power)
5. truncate(decimal,number) // leave after the decimal point (.) 'number' of digits 
    ex. truncate(10.256,2) ==> // 10.25 
    ex. truncate(10.256,3) ==> // 10.000 
    ex. truncate(10256,3) ==> // 10000 
6. Greatest(numbers_list)
7. least(numbers_list)

C. ------- Date Functions ----
1. curdate() or current_date(); ==> both the same 
2. curtime() or current_time(); ==> both the same 
3. now()  // returns date + time
4. month("date") // returns month
5. year("date") // returns year
6. day("date") // returns day

D. ------- Aggregate Functions ----
what is aggregate function?
it is all about performing calculations over multiple rows of a single column and resulting a single value
1. Min()
2. Max()
3. Sum()
4. AVG()
5. Count()

------------ Group By -----------
grouping multiple rows into a summary rows

----- Having ------
Used only with Group By and it is applied on summary row 

--- order by ----
sorting the result set (default is ascending)

------- Union & Union All -------
union is a set operator that works on two or more of two sets of results and combine the results  

----- joins ------
it is the process of combining the rows from two tables or more based on a common column 

what are the types of joins:
1. inner join
2. left outer join
3. right outer join
4. full join

------ subquery ------
it is a query inside another query, the outer query works on the results of the inner query 

how to find the second max salary?
select max(salary) from employees where salary<(select max(salary) from employees);

What are the types of the inner query?
there are two types of inner queries:
1. single row subquery ==> used with it : <>,  =,  <=,  >= 
2. multi row subquery  ==> used with it : IN, <ALL, >ALL, <ANY, >ANY

------- Integerity Constraints ---------
